    <div class="container main-text">
        <p>Since 1986, we’ve been recreating a little bit of Ireland at events across continental Europe - delivering reliable, premium event bar hire and Irish bar event rentals that feels like a real Irish pub. Our experienced Irish pub bartenders serve great Guinness on draught and other Irish drinks with pace, professionalism and a healthy dose of Irish banter. We’re here for the moments that matter: trade shows & exhibitions (lead-generating booth bars and on-stand after-parties), Ireland-themed nights, weddings, private events and festivals.
        </p>
        <p>Over the decades we’ve earned our reputation the right way, one excellent pint at a time, turning exhibition aisles into meeting points and receptions into stories your guests retell. So what makes us different? 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>Our People: </span>Most of our team are Ireland-based with years behind busy bar counters, so expect fast hands, perfect pours, and natural hosts. Oh, and don’t be surprised if a bartender breaks into song: there’s usually a guitar near the bar, and we’re happy to belt one out
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Our Approach: </span>We realise that hiring us for your event is only one of numerous tasks on your to-do list, so we want to make your life easier. We do this by offering a no hassle service, where we just get on with things, while still paying attention to the finer details.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Recent pours and activations include convention halls such as Hannover Messegelände, Messe München and Nürnberg Messe, while we’re equally at home in Messe Frankfurt, Fira Barcelona (Gran Via) and Paris Nord Villepinte. From first enquiry to final breakdown, our promise is simple: setup that’s easy, service that’s seamless, and an atmosphere that feels authentically Irish. Wherever your event, make it memorable the Irish way. Book The Pop Up Irish Pub and create Emerald Memories - with Guinness on draught, friendly Irish pub bartenders, and a bar experience guests gravitate to.</p>
